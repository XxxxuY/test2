      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
      road today:
      </p>
    <blockquote>
      Passing cars,<br>
      When you can't see,<br>
      May getyou,<br>
      A glimpse,<br>
      Of eternity.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I Idefinitely won't be Passing any cars.

      My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, ipod,
      digital camera, and a protein bar, Just the essentials.As
      Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins
      with one Segway</q>.
